As a polymath, I'm passionate about philosophy, technology, art and mathematics. Grew up wanting to become an artist. Went to engineering and mathematics. Held some art exhibitions in the past then started fashion design on the side. Worked as a Lead Data Scientist solving the most challenging problems in the industry: Vehicle routing, dynamic pricing, disease modelling, digital sensing. Started and led the MLOps team in the company. Now full circle back to design and bringing the next generation of fashion designand production to the world.
